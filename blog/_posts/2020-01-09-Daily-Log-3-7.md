## Day 3

<p style='color:orange; font-size: 36px'>TOTAL COMPLETED HOURS: 4</p>

### What I hope to achieve
My goal today is efficiency. I have made a late start and despite getting some stuff done in the morning I have also wasted a lot of time. I am trying to sleep earlier by gradual steps and today I would like to sleep by 11:15 pm. I have previously tried to push back my bedtime drastically but it almost never succeeds and I end up falling asleep much later than I otherwise would. Thus I have about 7h 30m until bedtime and I wish to get at least 6h 30m worth of work done. 

I am also going to experiment with a different strategy today and likely also the next few days which is do group together similar tasks and work on them simultaneously. The tasks themselves are, as before a combination of those I did yesterday or relatively recently and others which for some reason have high priority.
I am going to list a number of groups of tasks but I will focus on a couple of them today leaving the rest of later. 

### How it went

I was not particularly productive and was repeatedly distracted. But I managed to progress a little with the following:

- [x] NeRF implementation
- [x] Detection implementation
- [x] Graphics

I also did:

- [x] Sketching
