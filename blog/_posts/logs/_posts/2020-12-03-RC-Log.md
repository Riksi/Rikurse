Today I spent more time working on an assignment for [MIT 6.824: Distributed Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/) . I haven't done much coding using threads in the past, certainly nothing very complex, so there were some new ideas to grasp.

I tried to use the Go [race detector](https://blog.golang.org/race-detector) and it helped me to identify a number of obvious issues that I hadn't really thought about. 

I had something like this:

```go
func Inner (s *S)(){
	s.mu.Lock()
	defer mu.Unlock()

	// do something to s 
    return
}

func Outer (s *S)(){
	s.mu.Lock()
	defer s.mu.Unlock()
	
	// do something to s 

	go s.Inner()
	
    return 
}

func main() {
	s := new(S)
	s.Outer()
	time.Sleep(10 * time.Second)
	fmt.Println(s.outer, s.inner)
}
```

I was confused when were 2 race conditions. My understanding was that `Outer` having the lock would execute first and `Inner` would acquire the lock once `Outer` had released the lock and it would then be able to execute. 

I allowed a few seconds to elapse by which time I expected that the execution would be complete before adding the print statement. 

But I forgot that `s.outer` and `s.inner` are read in the print statement and reading the output of the race detector carefully I realised that this was causing the race conditions picked up.  

Thinking about this made me question what happens as a result of the return statement in `Outer`. Since `Outer` has returned in `main` supposing that it did not sleep for 10 seconds would `main` terminate before `Inner`? And I know you shouldn't rely merely on waiting to ensure all threads have executed.

I confirmed this was the case by omitting `time.Sleep` and adding a sleep statement inside `Inner` to extend its execution time. As a result `Inner` never completed. 

That made me think it was actually how I was dealing with `Inner` which was the reason for the race condition since my understanding is that `defer` ensures that the lock is released when the function returns. So you can't be sure `Inner` has returned when `fmt.Println` accesses `s`. 
When I got rid of `Inner`, no race conditions were detected.

Some of these matters were covered in 6.824 so I reviewed some [code examples](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/notes/crawler.go) from that. Then I changed it to look like this:


```go
func Inner (s *S)(){
	s.mu.Lock()
	defer s.mu.Unlock()

	// do something to s 
    return
}

func Outer (s *S)(){
	s.mu.Lock()

	// do something to s
    
    s.mu.Unlock()

    var done sync.WaitGroup
	done.Add(1)

	go func(){
    		s.Inner()
        	done.Done()
    	}
	done.Wait()
    return 
}

func main() {
	s := new(S)
	s.Outer()
	time.Sleep(10 * time.Second)
	fmt.Println(s.outer, s.inner)
}
```

Now, as I understand it, what happens is that the `WaitGroup` ensures that `done.Wait()` does not terminate until `done.Done` is called. I also found that the `defer` in `Outer` could not be used anymore and I had to `Unlock` it. I think that otherwise `Inner` will wait forever to acquire the lock which can't be released until everything else is finished including `done.Wait` which depends on `Inner` completing.

I am still not totally sure this is right but at least the race detector is no longer throwing warnings.
