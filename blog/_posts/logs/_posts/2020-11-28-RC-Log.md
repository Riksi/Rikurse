I woke up late today and was not as productive as I hoped but by following my time blocks system (which I will describe in another post) I managed to get some work done.

I continued to work on [HW 1](https://cs242.stanford.edu/f19/assignments/assign1) for [Stanford's CS242: Programming Languages](https://cs242.stanford.edu/f19). This is a new topic for me but since I have been programming for several years now, the ideas make more sense than they might have done if I had studied the course earlier. 

The first unit of the course covers [Syntax and Semantics](https://cs242.stanford.edu/f19/lectures/01-2-syntax-semantics). HW1 has 2 parts each of which have 2 questions. I have been working on the first 3 questions, which are as follows:

### Part 1
1. **Write a grammar for a JSON schema**
- You need to define what a property $p$ can be. Only strings or numbers have propertiesFor example a property is that a number is (<3 v >9) ^ =6 or that a string = 'z'. 
- Then you need to define a schema $\tau$ which specifies what the JSON string should match, in terms of the properties. 
- This was not too difficult once I understood what the question was asking. However it is possible that I am missing something given my doubts about the solution to the next question which follows on from this one. 
<br>

2. **Define inference rules to determine if a given JSON string is valid according to the schema**
- There is a tilde $\sim$ they use. For example a valid schema could include a boolean defined as `bool` which leads to the unconditional rules `true` $\sim$  `bool` and `false` $\sim$ `bool`. I thought it meant "equivalent" but from the text I think it means "matches". I learned from Wikipedia that $\sim$  (preceded by "=") is used for regex matching so that makes some sense.
- From the notes I knew that some rules would have to terminate and others would be recursive but I needed to figure out that the rules needed to be written in terms of whether the properties $p$ were satisified. Everything in the string terminates at a string, number or boolean. A boolean is always valid if `bool` is allowed in the schema but strings and numbers are only valid if they satisfied the properties required of them in the schema. 
- They tell you that the reference solution has 13 rules. I am able to get different numbers depending on whether or not I introduced intermediate definitions grouping together different unary and logical operators. I have managed to get fewer than 13 with some of the groupings but never 13 so I wonder what I can be missing.

### Part 2
1. **Write operational semantics for JSON accessors**
- Accessors are indices in an array or keys in a dict.  They had another kind of accessor $\|a$ which I have not encountered before but means apply this accessor to every element in a list.
- You have to write rules about what happens when you apply an accessor to a JSON object. The accessor can be something like $[1]'x'[2]\|[9]'y'$ which I think means 
<br>
`[i[9]['y'] for i in j[1]['x'][2]]`.
- The important thing is that each rule must only involve one step e.g. going from $j$ to $j[1]$. 
- They give you some examples which helps. This time I managed to end up with 4 rules. I will have a better sense of whether I am on the track when I do the final question which follows on from this.

2. **TODO: (I will add some notes here when I'm done with this)**

### Next steps
The HW1 doesn't have solutions so I can’t be sure that what I have done is right but my feeling is that after progressing further through the course I will have a better sense of whether or not I was on the right track. 

I am going to have a go at writing solutions for all the 4 problems. Then I will move on to the next section. The bits I don't understand will probably make sense afterwards.  I will try to keep to the weekly rhythm. I am not taking this a university course so I don’t have any barriers to cross other than to feel satisfied that I understand enough to move ahead. 

At some point in the course I would like to work on a project probably something involving AI and I will have "passed" the course if I manage to acquire knowledge and skills enough to achieve that.
