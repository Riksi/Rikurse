## Day 4

<p style='color:orange; font-size: 36px'>TOTAL COMPLETED HOURS: [target = 12]</p>

### What I hope to do today

I interleaved exercise with continuation of my studies from the day before to avoid making a late start to the day which tends to happen when I begin with a long block of exercise. I am going to carry on with experiment from yesterday of doing several things in parallel. I am also going to ensure that I devote at least 30 minutes towards the tasks that I have yet to begin.

I think it might be more feasible to do everything if my goal is have different frequencies for different task. The difficulty is determining the right frequency.
