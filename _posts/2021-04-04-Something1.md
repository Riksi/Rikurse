Given a matrix $M$ with eigenvalues $\Lambda$ and eigenvectors $U$ how do you find a unique matrix $\sqrt{M}$ such that $\sqrt{M}\sqrt{M} = M$ and $\sqrt{M}$ has positive eigenvalues?

We can write:

$$ MV = V \Lambda $$

Now left multiply both sides by M:

$$MMV = M \Lambda V \\
= M^2V = VLL = VL^2 \\
\implies M^2V = VL^2 $$

where $M^2$ is defined as $MM$. Since $\Lambda$ is diagonal $(\Lambda^2)_{ij} = (\Lambda\_{ij})^2$. From the above we can see that a matrix and its square have the same eigenvectors but the eigenvalues get squared. 

Going back to the initial question we can write:

$$\sqrt{M} = V \sqrt{\Lambda}V^{-1}$$

where I am assuming without justification for the moment that $V^{-1}$ exists. Another square root of $M$ is $-\sqrt{M}$ but this has negative eigenvalues.

Questions for myself:
- Here we assumed that $U$ is invertible? What is the justification? Is this always true? Can you have square root if it is not?
- If dealing with complex numbers at least one eigenvalue is guaranteed. Does this mean any matrix will have a square root possibly a complex one? I would imagine that this depends on the answer to above.
