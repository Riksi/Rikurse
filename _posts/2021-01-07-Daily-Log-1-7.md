## Introduction
I am going to try to stick to a consistent schedule doing (mostly) the same things at the same times as far as possible for the next 7 days. I will need to vary it somehow after this period in order to remain motivated to maintain it.

## Continuity issues

A simple heuristic I am going to try today to avoid feeling like my brain has been reset when I wake up each morning is to start of by working for a while on the tasks I did the day before starting backwards from the last task kind of like how you knit the last stitch first to start a new row.

## What I want to do today

The lists are in priority order although not the subtasks within the third list. Anything I don’t finish will get moved forward to 08.01.2021.
