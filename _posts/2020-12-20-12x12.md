There are 12 days left of 2020 starting from today and my target is to spend on average 12 productive hours each day.  

An additional goal is to try to ensure ensure I spend at least 80% of the time on RC work = deep work.

## Notes
### What counts as productive
- My RC work
- Work related to my business ideas so long as it is not primarily admin
- Learning about finance, economics and investing
- Activities for physical and mental fitness e.g. walking, yoga, breathing exercises
- Art
- Technical blogging
- Writing briefly about what I am doing in RC 
- Some language learning e.g. Duolingo lessons, practising writing or speaking in that language

### What does not
- Activities of every day life e.g. meals, washing, tidying
- Planning
- Language learning where it is an auxiliary purpose of an activity e.g. reading a book or watching a film in another language
- Admin broadly defined 

Neither list is meant to be exhaustive but they are indicative of the kinds of tasks that I will count for the challenge.
