**My overarching goal is to follow Paul Graham’s advice to turn myself into 'the sort of person who can have organic startup ideas'\***.

## Courses

I don't know how many of these it is feasible to finish in about 12 weeks but I wish to do as much as possible.

**Key:** &nbsp; ⬜ To Do &nbsp; ✴️  In Progress &nbsp; ✅ Done &nbsp; 🟨 Target is to finish by end of RC &nbsp; 🟢 Programming Parts Done &nbsp; 🔵 A self-contained section complete; <span class="highlight" style="color:transparent; border: 1px solid black; font-weight bold">[ ]</span> **Tasks for challenge**
