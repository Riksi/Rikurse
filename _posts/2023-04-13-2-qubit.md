## Introduction

The [one-clean-qubit model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Clean_Qubit) lets you estimate the normalised trace $\mathrm{Tr}(U)/\mathrm{Tr}(I)$ of an $n$-qubit gate $U$ which is a task for which no known classical poly-time algorithm exists according to this [problem description](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.371.2x+2T2018/courseware/Week3/ps3/?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AMITx%2B8.371.2x%2B2T2018%2Btype%40sequential%2Bblock%40ps3) from [MIT 8.371.2x: Quantum Information Science II, Part 2](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.371.2x+2T2018/course/) from the [MIT Open Learning Library](https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library).

This can be achieved using a circuit of the form

<p class='p-img' markdown=1>

</p>

which can be expressed as `[H(0), CU(0, 1), H(0)]`
It can easily be shown that the approach works for arbitrary values of $n$. The assignment problem asks you to implement the circuit for a 2 qubit gate `V = [U(0), CNOT(0, 1), U(1), CNOT(1, 0)]`

Note that:
- Numbering for qubits increases from bottom to top.
- The gates are applied from left to right
- For example in matrix form `[X(0), Y(1), Z(0)]` would be `Z(0) x Y(1) x X(0)`


## Controlled-$U$ gates

Assuming that bit 0 is the control bit, any controlled-U (CU) gate has the form

$$\begin{bmatrix}
I & 0 \\
0 & U
\end{bmatrix}$$

Suppose $U = U_1 \cdot U_2\cdot \ldots \cdot U_n$, then the gate can also be implemented as a sequence of gates 

$$\begin{bmatrix}
I & 0 \\
0 & U_1 \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix}
I & 0 \\
0 & U_2 \end{bmatrix} \times \cdots \times \begin{bmatrix}
I & 0 \\
0 & U_n \end{bmatrix}$$

For the gate `V` in this problem we have `V = CNOT(2, 1) x U(2) x CNOT(1, 2) x U(1)` (since gates are applied from left to right in the list, matrix multiplication goes right to left), where `U` is an arbitrary unitary matrix.



The question required you to give the circuit to estimate the trace for V, assuming you had access to controlled-U `CU`. The key aspect was to implement controlled-V. 

## Initial Approach using Toffoli Gate

It would seem you can quite straightforwardly construct 

```
CV = [CU(0,1), Toffoli(0, 1, 2) x CU(0, 1), Toffoli(0, 2, 1)]
``` 
<p class='p-img' markdown=1>
![Circuit 2-qubit controlled-V]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/CV-3qubit.png)
</p>
where [Toffoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toffoli_gate) is the controlled [CNOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_NOT_gate) gate, a **3-qubit** gate which causes CNOT to be applied only if the qubit 0 is 1. 

$$\text{CNOT} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} I & 0 \\ 0 & \text{X}\end{bmatrix}$$

$$\text{Toffoli}=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} I & 0 \\ 0 & \text{CNOT}\end{bmatrix} $$

The problem arose when the grader seemed not to accept the Toffoli gate. Initially I tried a number of variations `TOFFOLI`, `TOFF`, `CCX`, `CCNOT`, `toffoli`. I finally discovered that the accepted value was `Toffoli`! But before that, I assumed that it must be the case that this particular gate was realisable using only 2-qubit gates and that this is what the answer expected so I spent some time trying construct controlled-V in this fashion.

## A 2-qubit version of Toffoli

I learned that it is possible to construct `Toffoli` as well as other 3-qubit gates with 2 control qubits using only 2-qubit gates. The following is a circuit for `Toffoli` gate using 6 CNOT gates and a number of single qubit gates.

![Circuit diagram of Toffoli gate built using only 2 qubit gates]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/toffoli.png)

However when I input this sequence in place of Toffoli, the grader failed to return a response of correct or not. It might have been a timeout in the backend maybe because of the large number of gates involved. It returned the following error

```
Couldn't execute jailed code: stdout: b'', stderr: b'' with status code: -24
```

It is suggested [here](https://groups.google.com/g/openedx-ops/c/xokwJaqdRgE) that a timeout might possibly be the reason.

This got me thinking whether the overall `V` could be realised without having to rely on a Toffoli gate. Turns out that it can. 

## Alternative Circuit without Toffoli
I first thought about what happens when you simply substitute `U` with `CU`. The resulting circuit is

```
[CU(0, 1), CNOT(1, 2), CU(0, 2), CNOT(2, 1)] 
```

When qubit 0 is 1, the result is `[U(1), CNOT(1, 2), U(2), CNOT(2, 1)] = V` but when qubit 0 is 0, it is `[CNOT(1, 2), CNOT(2, 1)]` which is not the identity. 

Now `CNOT(x, y)` is its own inverse and there are two `CNOT` gates in this circuit but as it stands they don't cancel since the control and target qubits are different in each case. But what if you could make it so that when qubit 0 is 0, `CNOT(1, 2)` is applied both times?

## CNOT and Hadamard Transform Property
`CNOT` has a special property that when you apply a [Hadamard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_transform#Quantum_computing_applications) transform to the inputs and outputs of `CNOT(x, y)`, the result is `CNOT(y, x)` i.e. the control and target qubits are flipped

![Diagram showing how CNOT can be flipped by applying Hadamard transform to the inputs and outputs]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/cnot_hadamard.png)

<small>Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_NOT_gate#/media/File:CNOT_Hadamard_Basis.svg), created by DavidBoden ([CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/))</small>

The ability to flip CNOT using only single qubit gates is key to the solution. Because as we have seen, it suffices to control the order of qubits input to the CNOT gate and not whether the CNOT gate is applied. 

Now assume we have access to controlled-Hadamard gates (as was the case in the assignment but see [below](#alternate-controlled-h-construction) for how you can construct one using Pauli matrices and rotations). If we construct the second CNOT gate `CNOT(2,1)` using `CNOT(1,2)` and the controlled versions of H, then `CNOT(1, 2)` will only get flipped when qubit 0 is 1. Therefore when qubit 0 is 0 it will invert the other `CNOT(1, 2)`.

## A 2-qubit Controlled-$V$ Circuit

The circuit for controlled-V is as follows:

```
CV = [CU(0, 1), CNOT(1, 2), CU(0, 2), 
      CH(0, 1), CH(0, 2), CNOT(1, 2), CH(0, 2), CH(0, 1)]
```

<p class='p-img' markdown=1>
![Circuit for 2-qubit controlled-V]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/CV-2qubit.png)
</p>
Sadly the grader kept failing for this circuit as well i.e. returning the same error as before and not responding with correct or incorrect.

However we can verify that the circuit is indeed equivalent to controlled-V. When qubit 0 is 1, the gates controlled by qubit 0 are applied so that qubits 1 and 2 are transformed as 

```
[U(1), CNOT(1, 2), U(2), H(1), H(2), CNOT(1, 2), H(2), H(1)]
 = [U(1), CNOT(1, 2), U(2), CNOT(2, 1)] = V
```

and when qubit 0 is 0, only the gates not controlled by qubit 0 are applied so qubits 1 and 2 are transformed as 

```
[CNOT(1, 2), CNOT(1, 2)] = I
```

Since the circuit applies V when qubit 0 is 1 and identity when qubit 0 is 0, it satisfies the definition of controlled-V. 

To use this for trace estimation you simply need to apply a Hadamard transform to qubit 0 at the input and output.

A notebook that verifies the circuit using matrices can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Tn7j8gH_PReIkDUIL6byJjkzun0mcXU4?usp=sharing).

## Alternate Controlled-$H$ Construction

You can construct `CH` using a combination of a `CNOT` and rotations since

$$H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1\\1 & -1\end{bmatrix} = R_Y\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \cdot X \cdot R_Y\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)$$

This follows from the fact that

$$R_Y(\alpha) = \exp\left(-i\frac{\alpha}{2}Y\right) = I\cos\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) - iY\sin\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)$$

You can construct the circuit as 

<p class='p-img' markdown=1>
![Controlled-Hadamard using CNOT and rotation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/CH-rotation.png)
</p>
When qubit 0 is 1, the output is $R_Y\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \cdot X \cdot R_Y\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = H$ and when qubit 0 is 0, the output is $R_Y\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \cdot R_Y\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = I$, as required.
